❄️ Premium Winter Gear E-Commerce (Sale Capstone)
🚀 Project Overview
Premium Winter Gear E-Commerce is a capstone project designed to simulate a high-impact, seasonal Winter Clearance Event. It demonstrates full-stack proficiency in creating a dynamic e-commerce environment focused on promoting discounted products, managing inventory, and providing a clean, conversion-focused user interface.

The project highlights the ability to manage complex pricing logic (original price vs. sale price) and deliver an attractive, brand-consistent user experience.

✨ Key Features Demonstrated
1. High-Impact UI/UX
Promotional Banner: Features a dominant "WINTER CLEARANCE EVENT" banner with strong visual contrast and clear messaging ("Up to 70% Off Everything!").

Responsive Design: Ensures the sale page and product listings render correctly across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Clear Sale Communication: Utilizes visually distinct badges (e.g., "60% OFF") and crossed-out original prices to clearly communicate value to the customer.

2. Product Presentation & Logic
Dynamic Product Listing: Displays featured products with minimal, clean cards under an engaging section title ("🔥 Must-Have Deals").

Pricing Logic: Implements the core logic to calculate and display:

The original price ($120.00).


The discounted sale price ($48.00).

The percentage discount

Quick Add Functionality: (Conceptual/JS-driven) Buttons to quickly add items to the cart, enhancing the checkout funnel.

3. Backend Integration (Conceptual for Capstone)
Sale Management API: Endpoint to flag products as onSale and apply a specific discountPercentage (e.g., via an Admin Dashboard).

Inventory Tracking: Ensures that sale items correctly reflect their current stock levels.
